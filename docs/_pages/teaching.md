I am an instructor for *Probability & Statistics I*, an elementary probability and statistics course, in the spring 2023 semester. I have also been the instructor for *Introduction to Applied Math*, an introductory differential equations course for undergraduates in engineering and the sciences.  

For short descriptions of these courses, look for **Math 1110** and **Math 2240** on the [Tulane catalog of math courses](https://catalog.tulane.edu/courses/math/).  

## Brief thoughts about teaching 
I take pride in my teaching. As a student in high school and college, I never considered myself a particularly strong math student. With that in mind, I empathize with students who approach their math courses with anxiety. I strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and empowered by the fact that with some effort and patience, they too can "do math."
